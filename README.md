# Audio-Classification-Web-Application
This project focuses on training 5 classifiers on an audio dataset using the sklearn library. 
Confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-measure are displayed for the trained classifiers. 
The project incorporates Flask, a Python web framework, to create a user-friendly web application for interacting with the classifiers. 
Users can input test cases, and the application creatively displays the results.
